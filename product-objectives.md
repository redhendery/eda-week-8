Objectives for Full Bano Site:

1. Promote exisiting content
2. Attract content creators

1. Promote Existing Content:

The goal of promoting our existing content is to showcase the groups talent of individual members and what has been achieved by the team when working as a collective.

2. Attract Content Creators:

By attracting content creators we have a chance to create something new, something different and something great. As a collective we do these things for love and getting this message across is key to attracting other people to work with us.

3. Attract potential business:

As a group or individuals if we have an oppurtunity to work with (or for) local business we will. We have the talent and equipment to create promotional videos, short movies, music videos, audio podcasts and more.

4. Provide Simple and Clear Contact Methods:

I feel that simple clear contact methods are important as our focus is on creating content with and for people. The easier it is for the user to contact us the better. By limiting the contact methods to common and established forms of contact (email, twitter) this shoud help streamline the process for users.
