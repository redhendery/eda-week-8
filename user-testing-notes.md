Testing Notes:

User did not know what a "Landing Page" was, but once got the idea when was quickly explained.

User liked idea of short descriptions of video content.

User liked simpleness of "Contact" page and the idea of direct Twitter and Email links.

My Notes:

I wondered if the "Landing Page" was the best approach, but decided to stick with it as this splash page gives you an idea of what you will see inside the site.

The limited options the site gave the user clear and simple decisions to make. The obvious heading names let the user see where to go to get what they wanted.
